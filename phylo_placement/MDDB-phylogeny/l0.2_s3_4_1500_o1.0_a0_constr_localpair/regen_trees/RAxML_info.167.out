IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences SH1160652.08FU_MT443943_reps and SH1167027.08FU_MF176009_reps are exactly identical

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 1 sequence that is exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.

An alignment file with sequence duplicates removed has already
been printed to file MDDB-phylogeny/l0.2_s3_4_1500_o1.0_a0_constr_localpair/chunks/aligned/167_1082_p__Ascomycota_c__Sordariomycetes_o__Hypocreales.fasta.reduced

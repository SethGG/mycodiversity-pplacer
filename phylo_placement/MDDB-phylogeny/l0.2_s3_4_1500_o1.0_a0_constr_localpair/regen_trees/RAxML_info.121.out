IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences SH1230784.08FU_MT569903_reps and SH1230743.08FU_MF466160_refs are exactly identical

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 1 sequence that is exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.

An alignment file with sequence duplicates removed has already
been printed to file MDDB-phylogeny/l0.2_s3_4_1500_o1.0_a0_constr_localpair/chunks/aligned/121_129_p__Ascomycota_c__Dothideomycetes_o__Botryosphaeriales.fasta.reduced
